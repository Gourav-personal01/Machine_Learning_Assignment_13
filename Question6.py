# Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?

# Aanswer - 


# Differences Between Lasso and Ridge Regularization:

# Lasso uses L1 regularization, which adds the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty term.
# Ridge regularization uses L2 regularization, which adds the squared values of the coefficients as a penalty term.

# Lasso can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing the corresponding predictors from the model.
# Ridge can shrink coefficients close to zero but rarely drives them exactly to zero. It reduces the magnitude of all coefficients.

# Lasso is more suitable for feature selection because it can eliminate irrelevant predictors.
# Ridge can shrink coefficients but does not perform explicit feature selection.
