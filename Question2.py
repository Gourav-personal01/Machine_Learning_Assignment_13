# Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?


# # Aanswer - 

#  Lasso has a built-in feature selection mechanism. By setting some coefficients to zero, it effectively removes less relevant predictors from the model.

#  Lasso can handle multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors) by selecting one of the correlated predictors and setting the coefficients of the others to zero. This can simplify the model and reduce overfitting.

# Lasso provides a more interpretable model because it sets some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing predictors. This makes it easier to identify the most important variables.
